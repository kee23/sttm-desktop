### How do I search for a shabad?

After launching STTM, by default you can search for a shabad by entering the first letter of each word. For example, if the shabad is ਗੁਰੁ ਮੇਰੈ ਸੰਗਿ ਸਦਾ ਹੈ ਨਾਲੇ , you would enter "gmsshn".'" ![](https://www.sikhitothemax.org/assets/images/help/desktop-search-ex.png) Alternatively, you can click on the gurmukhi keyboard icon and type in the letters manually. ![](https://www.sikhitothemax.org/assets/images/help/desktop-keyboard.png)

### What do the different search types do?

*   First Letter (Start)
    *   The letters you input must be from the START of a line in a shabad.
*   First Letter (Anywhere)
    *   The letters you input can be from any part of the line. For example, you can start your search by typing in the first letter of every word in the second half of a shabad’s line.
*   Full Word (Gurmukhi)
    *   You can type in the full word(s) in gurmukhi that you are searching for.
*   English Translation (Full Word)
    *   You can search for shabads via the english translations. For example, type in the word "bird" and the results will show all shabads that include a translation for "bird".

### I can't find my shabad.

*   STTM's database includes shabads from Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji, Sri Dasam Granth Sahib, Bhai Gurdas Jee, Bhai Gurdas Singh Jee, Bhai Nand Lal Jee, and various rehatnamas and thankhanamas. If your shabad is not from one of those sources, it will not appear.
*   If you verified your shabad should be in the database and it is still not coming up, make sure you are typing in the correct letters for search. If you aren’t sure about a letter, or are still having difficulties, try using one of the different search types to locate the shabad.
